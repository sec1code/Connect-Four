# Connect-Four

## Description
A consoled based connect four game written in Java. The ui is in German, but the programm is pretty self-explanatory so that should be no problem.

## How to play the game
1. Download the code
2. Open an IDE(I use eclipse) and import the project
3. Press the run button
4. Enjoy :^)

### More Information
This is my first somewhat difficult project that I made without using a tutorial. I hope you like it.

### Possible Bugs
If you get an error message that some characters can't  be represented, you need to change the encoding of the project to UTF-8.
Here is an article that explains how to that with the Eclipse IDE: https://www.w3schools.io/editor/eclipse-encoding/
